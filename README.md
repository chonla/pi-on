# Pi-On
Make your Pi ready
----

Because of preparing a SD card for a Pi depends on several steps, Pi-On comes to wrap them up to a single command.

1. Insert your micro-sd into sd-card reader port.
2. Run the following command and Pi-On will do the rest.

```sh
sudo ./pi-on.sh <diskid>
```

For example
```sh
sudo ./pi-on.sh disk2
```

Please note that Pi-On will install the latest version of JESSIE Lite from Raspberry Pi website to SD card.
